# Logistic-Regression

This is helpful to understand the way to write the code and optimise an objective function.

The aim is to fit a model to the data, so that predictions about the customers’ purchase behavior in future can be made. The model is defined by four parameters namely r, α, a, b and they are always greater than 0. For fitting the model (i.e. finding the parameters r, α, a, b),
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) can be used. The log likelihood (LL) function which is to be maximized is given as follows
